# Strategy

* Naive Approach:
  - Brute force O(n^2) nested for loop that iterates through every value for each value in the array. Has O(1) space since we're not using any additional data structures.

* Optimized Approach:
  - Use a hashmap and check if the difference(target-num) exists. If it does, return the indices in a list. Else, add the number and index to the hashmap.

  - We only have to iterate through the list once leading to linear O(n) time.
