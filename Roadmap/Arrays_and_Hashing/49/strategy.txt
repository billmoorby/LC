# Strategy

* Optimized Approach:
  - Create a default dictionary of lists so we can store each anagram group in its own list.

  - For every string in the list, create a binary list that stores the ASCII value.

  - Append to that list if we see a character.

  - Turn that binary list into the key for each ASCII group(remember to convert to a tuple).
