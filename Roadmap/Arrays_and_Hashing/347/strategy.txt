# Strategy

* Optimized Approach:
  - Use bucket sort to contain all possible "k" frequencies (0, to the length of the list).

  - Create a dictionary to store the frequency and then iterate through it to populate the bucket array with the numbers that are of a certain frequency.

  - Finally, go through the bucket array backwards so we can get the top 'k' elements.
