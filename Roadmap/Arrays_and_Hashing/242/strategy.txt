# Strategy

* Naive Approach:
  - Sorting the array first can lead to O(n log n) time complexity in the worst case.

  - Has O(n) space complexity.

  - "return sorted(s) == sorted(t)"


* Optimized Approach:
  - 1st, check if both the 2 strings are of equal length. If not, we can return False and exit early.

  - We create 2 hashmaps and check if they are equal.
