# Time Complexity: O(n^2) or O(1)

* Best Time Complexity is O(n^2)
  - This is because we have to go through the entire NxN grid to check if the Sudoku board is valid.

  - We can think of the time complexity as constant O(1), since the board size is fixed to be 9x9.

  - For general NxN boards, the time complexity is O(n^2).


# Space Complexity: O(n^2) or O(1)

* Best Space Complexity is O(n^2) for GENERAL (NxN) board, and O(1) for a fixed (9x9) board.
  - In the worst case, we have a FULLY FILLED-OUT VALID Sudoku board, so every row is filled, and every column is filled. This means all 9 squares are filled.

  - This means that for each of the 9 rows in the row_map, we will store at most 9 unique digits. Leads to 81 digits.

  - For each of the 9 columns in the col_map, we will store at most 9 unique digits. leads to 81 digits.

  - For each of the 9 squares in the square_map, we will store at most 9 unique digits. Leads to 81 digits.

  - In the worst case, all 3 maps are filled leading to O(81*3) space. This is a fixed upper bound so technically the space is constant O(1) for a 9x9 board.

  - A general NxN board would have O(n^2) space complexity.
