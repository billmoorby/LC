# Strategy

* Naive Approach:
  - Go through EACH element, and check if (n+1) exists. If not, or streak end, repeat process with the NEXT element. Leads to O(n^2) runtime.

* Optimized Approach:
  - Create a set to store all the numbers and iterate through them.

  - Check if (n-1) exists. If not, we have a NEW streak.

  - Continue checking for (n+1) until we have a new streak. Update the streak with the new max streak.
