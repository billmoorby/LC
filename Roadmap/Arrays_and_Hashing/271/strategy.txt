# Strategy

* Naive Approach:
  - Just take all the strings in the list and combine them for the encoding method. Problem is when we try to decode it back to the original strings, since we do not have a delimiter.

* Optimized Approach:
  - We want to create a DELIMITER.

  - One way is to figure out the length of the string and append it to the start of the encoded string.
    - WHAT IF the string had an integer? Need another delimiter like "#".

    - EX: ["lint", "co#de"] --> "4#lint5$co#de"
  
  - EX: ["lint", "code", "love", "you"]
    - enc = encode(["lint", "code", "love", "you"]) --> "4#lint4#code4#love3#you"

    - decode(enc) --> ["lint", "code", "love", "you"]
