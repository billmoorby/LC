# Time Complexity: O(n)

* Time Complexity for encode() is O(n).
  - We are iterating through all 'n' strings in the strs array in encode().

  - For each string we are concatenating the length of the string and a delimiter which takes constant O(1) time.

# Time Complexity for decode() is O(n).
  - We are iterating through a encoded string of 'n' characters.

  - For each string we are performing slice operations.


# Space Complexity: O(n)

* Space Complexity for encode() is O(n).
  - Our final encoded string contains all the characters in our 'n' strings plus our additional delimiters.

* Space Complexity for decode() is O(n).
  - The output list is equal to the original list of size 'n' strings.
