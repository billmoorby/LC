# Time Complexity: O(n)

* We are calculating the prefix and postfix products. This requires 2 passes of the array.

* The first pass gets the products of the elements to the LEFT.

* The second pass gets the products of the elements to the RIGHT.


# Space Complexity: O(n) or O(1)

* The "res" array size depends on the number of 'n' elements in the "nums" array.

* The "left_prod" and right_prod" variables are constant space.

* If the problem does NOT count the output array as extra space, since we have to return it anyway, the space is constant O(1) space.
