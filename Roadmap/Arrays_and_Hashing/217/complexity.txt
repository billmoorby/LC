# Time Complexity: O(n)

* Time Complexity is O(n) since we iterate through all 'n' characters in the array in the worst case.
  - The hashmap lookups and insertions all take constant O(1) time.


# Space Complexity: O(n)

* In the worst case, we have no duplicates and we end up storing ALL 'n' elements in the hashmap, leading to O(n) space.
