* Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/description/

* Given an integer array "nums", return "True" if any value appears at least TWICE in the array, and return "False" if every element is distinct.


# Example 1:
  - Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 1]

  - Output: True

  - Explaination: The element '1' occurs at the indices 0 and 3.

# Example 2:
  - Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]

  - Output: False

  - Explaination: All elements are distinct.

# Example 3:
  - Input: nums = [1, 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 2, 4, 2]

  - Output: True


* Constraints:
  - 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5

  - -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
