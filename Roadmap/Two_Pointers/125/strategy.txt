# Strategy

* Naive Approach:
  - Using the join() method creates a NEW string of linear O(n) space.

  - lower() and replace() both create NEW strings of linear O(n) space if used on the ENTIRE STRING.


* Optimized Approach:
  - Use 2 pointers so we can achieve O(n) time.

  - Use while loop to filter out non-alphanumeric characters using the isalnum() method.

  - No new data structures are created when we call isalnum() and lower() methods on a SINGLE character instead of the entire string. This is due to the constant time lookups using the lookup map.
