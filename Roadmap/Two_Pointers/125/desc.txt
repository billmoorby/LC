# 125: Valid Palindrome

* Difficulty: Easy

* Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-palindrome/description/

* A phrase is a palindrome if, after converting all uppercase letters into lowercase letters and removing all non-alphanumeric characters, it reads the same forward and backward. Alphanumeric characters include letters and numbers.

* Given a string 's', return 'True', if it is a palindrome, or 'False' otherwise.



# Example 1:
  - Input: s = "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"

  - Output: True

  - Explaination: "amanaplanacanalpanama" is a palindrome.

# Example 2:
  - Input: s = "race a car"

  - Output: True

  - Explaination: "racecar" is not a palindrome.

# Example 3:
  - Input: s = " "

  - Output: True

  - Explaination: s is an empty string "" after removing non-alphanumeric characters. Since an empty string reads the same forward and backward, it is a palindrome.



* Constraints:
  - 1 <= s.lengt <= 2*10^5

  - s consists only of printable ASCII characters.
